Self project (work in progress)

This is a classification project to predict whether a machine will fail or not based on sensor data.
The goal is to explore feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation on a real-world-like dataset.

Problem type: Binary classification (failure vs. no failure)

Data source: [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerrtx/machine-failure-prediction-using-sensor-data/data)

Current status: Experimenting with EDA and different machine learning models. Not finished yet.
